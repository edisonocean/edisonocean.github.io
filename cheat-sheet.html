            <h3>In JavaScript, almost "everything" is an object.</h3>

                <ul>
                  <li>Booleans can be objects (or primitive data treated as objects)</li>
                  <li>Numbers can be objects (or primitive data treated as objects)</li>
                  <li>Strings can be objects (or primitive data treated as objects)</li>
                  <li>Dates are always objects</li>
                  <li>Maths are always objects</li>
                  <li>Regular expressions are always objects</li>
                  <li>Arrays are always objects</li>
                  <li>Functions are always objects</li>
                  <li>Objects are objects</li>
                  <li>In JavaScript, all values, except primitive values, are objects.</li>
                </ul>
              <p>Primitive values are: strings ("John Doe"), numbers (3.14), true, false, null, and undefined.</p>
              <h3>Objects are Variables Containing Variables</h3>
              <p>JavaScript variables can contain single values: </p>

                  <dl>
                    <dt>var person = {</dt>
                      <dd>firstName:"John",</dd>
                      <dd>lastName:"Doe",</dd>
                      <dd>age:50,</dd>
                      <dd>eyeColor:"blue"</dd>
                    <dt>};</dt>
                  </dl>
             <h3>JavaScript variables can contain single values:</h3>
                var person = "John Doe";
             <h3>Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.</h3>
                The values are written as name : value pairs (name and value separated by a colon)
                var person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};
         </div>



          <div class="paragraph">
            <h3>JavaScript Object Properties</h3>
            <p>A JavaScript object is a collection of unordered properties.
                  Properties can usually be changed, added, and deleted, but some are read only.
                  The syntax for accessing the property of an object is:</p>
                  objectName.property          // person.age
                  objectName["property"]       // person["age"]
                  objectName[expression]       // x = "age"; person[x]
                  objectName[expression]       // x = "age"; person[x]

                  <p>There are two different ways to access an object property:</p>
                  <p>You can use .property or ["property"].</p>
                  <dl>
                    <dt>var person = {</dt>
                      <dd>firstName:"John",</dd>
                      <dd>lastName:"Doe",</dd>
                      <dd>age:50,</dd>
                      <dd>eyeColor:"blue"</dd>
                    <dt>};</dt>
                  </dl>
                  <h3>JavaScript for...in Loop</h3>
                  <p>The JavaScript for...in statement loops through the properties of an object.</p>
                  <p>var person = {fname:"John", lname:"Doe", age:25};</p>
                      <dl>
                        <dt>for (x in person) {</dt>
                         <dd> txt += person[x];</dd>
                         <dd> }</dd>
                      </dl>
                      <h3>Property Attributes</h3>
                        <p>All properties have a name. In addition they also have a value.

                        The value is one of the property's attributes.

                        Other attributes are: enumerable, configurable, and writable.

                        These attributes define how the property can be accessed (is it readable?, is it writable?)

                        In JavaScript, all attributes can be read, but only the value attribute can be changed (and only if the property is writable).

                        ( ECMAScript 5 has methods for both getting and setting all property attributes)</p>

          <div class="paragraph">
          <h1> Prototype function </h1>
          <p>
          The prototype function is an essential concept for javascript. All javascript functions have a prototype property however you can't access them through a for/in loop.

          The prototype function allows you to base the functionality of one object on another object. Meaning it acts as a pointer to another object.

          Here is a great example...lets say you love action movies and catch phrases from action movies.

          For this we would need to create two different functions. One for the actor or actors and another function that lets the actor speak.</p>

          <div class="arnold">
          <img src="arnold.png" style="width:300px;height:300px"></div>

          <p>From the photo we can see that prototype allows us to point the arnold function to the catch phrase function by using prototype. This allows us to use the catch phrase function with multiple actors and not just arnold.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="objectmodel">
          <h1>Object Method </h1>

          Javascript has Object Methods to give action to something.

          For example there is the getElementByid Method. This allows us to find an html by it's id tag.

          If you want to create a javascript object method it would have to include a methodname, a function, and a body. 

          methodName: function() {body}

          To acess an object method you would call the object name and then the methodName().

          For example

          objectName.methodName()
          </div>
       </body>
</html>
