      Version Control: While some may think programmers sit alone throught the night working and hacking away at the next brilliant program that will change the world, the reality is that most programers work in colaboration. Sometimes, lengthy geographical distance becomes an issue to deal with. The web has created a good solution for this. Programs like GitHub and Git have made it easy for multiple people around the globe to colaborate on the same project with minimal potential of creating errors. GitHub and Git allow programers to create copies of the same program to work on individually; Furthermore, it allows them to record progress points that can be retrieved to correct mistakes or to develop further.
    </p>
    <p>
        Git is a similar program to GitHub. The main difference is that it lives on a home computer. This allows programers to download a version of the original project, work on a copied version, record progress points, and exchange updates with the original. All the while, allowing the programer access to the any progress points of other programers working on the same thing.

    <p>
        GitHub is a website with the capability to store a project; Additionally, it allows someone with a GitHub account the freedom to create branches that stem from the original project to their personal GitHub account. From there, they can download it to their own computer and edit as they see fit.
