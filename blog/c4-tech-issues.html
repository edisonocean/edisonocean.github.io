  <h1>Phase-0</h1>
  <h2>Tech Issues</h2>
  <h4>Monday, Jan 19th, 2015</h4>



    <p>
      If we take a look at the Tech Industry, we see that it has it's own share of problems. Not just who is the biggest profitting entity providing the most advanced gadgets. Tho that race is a fervent one, there are other issues that require a more architectural approach.
    <p>
        I took a look at the Mobile Device industry. It seems that one of the biggest challenges is the demand for more capacity. People using 3G devices have experienced touchy and dodgy service. Especially because traditional network infrastructure is designed to manage 2G service. There is a tug of war, however, in the supply and demand of service. folks in rural areas are starting to demand better service. But for companies, the return is so minimal, it's not worth putting the money and effort in upgrading towers. On the other hand, people in urban areas are demanding more and more data capacity. This is in part due to businesses needing network abilities that expand to every room in their building. The Gaming world is also growing in numbers. The entertainment world is providing devices (ie. HD televisions, extremely fast computers, cable companies 500 plus channels, etc.) According to techradar.com the smartphone traffic is expected to increase 10 fold in the next 5 years.

        Finding a solution for such an issue seems to be at the top of the list. Part of the solution lies in the hands of big business. If they could update their network to accept LTE advances, less congestion would be expected in their local network. It seems to me big businesses could start creating networks that are capable of upgrades, as they arise so very quickly in the span of a year. The cost would be high at first but in the long run, there would be less problems. It's sort of the rideshare of the networking world.
