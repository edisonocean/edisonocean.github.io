  <h1>Phase-0</h1>
  <h2>Class Methods</h2>
  <h4>Saturday, January 31st</h4>



    <p>
      Welcome to my blog. In this episode we'll be discussing Class Methods!!!, I'll go ahead and define what that means and what they do. I'll provide examples and give a play by play "English" version of what it is that's happening.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a previous blog, I explained what a class is. But, just for a jolly good time, I'll go ahead and give a brief synopsis. Creating a class is much like creating something like a bicycle. Let me explain, in order for it to be functional for what it is normally intended for, a bike has to be able to carry a persons weight, have moving parts that correlate in a systematic way. Sometimes, the moving parts, such as bearings, are housed in such a way that the user will never see or touch them. But they still have a duty to the overall function and usability of the bike. The end result must allow the collection of the moving systems to be used by a person. Much like that, a class allows for different systems to work together to achieve a final result.
    </p>
    <p>In our example below, we have a class Bicycle which I've equipped with one class method and one instance method. Now methods in general are much like a containers that 'have' information in the form of instructions for a desired behavior aka function. Much like the parts on a bike in that they 'have', by their nature, information for their own behavior. For example, if you saw a set of bearings, you would know that their calling is, generally, for allowing some of the moving parts to move freely and without friction. Again, without being seen, they are required for the bike to work properly. So if I were to describe a class method, I would say it does just about the same thing when called upon. Like the bearings, it serves a function but is only accessible by the class itself. That means that a class method is used for housing functional information that applies to the internal overall workings of the class. So in English, bearings let the bike work and be ridable, but they have nothing to do with where, how, how long, why, and when a person will ride it. A class method is the same, it is there to allow the program to work but not for the individual instances that a person might feel the need to call on the class. That being said, they are limited in accessibility. They are only accessible by the overall class usually referred to 'self'. So to see (aka 'call') what the class method from the class Bicycle below is doing, your syntax would look something like this:
      <ul>
        <li>Bicycle.bearing</li>
      </ul>
    This would output => "Even though you can't see me, you wouldn't get far without me!!!". The syntax that you see below the class method is an example of an 'instance method'. Those are used much like replaceable pedals on our bike. Meaning, they are used when an instance arises a need to have to use them.
    </p>

</p>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>class Bicycle</li>
      <li></li>
      <li>def self.bearing</li>
      <li>puts "Even though you can't see me, you wouldn't get far without me!!!" </li>
      <li>end</li>
      <li></li>
      <li></li>
      <li>def initialize(dial, receive)</li>
      <li>@dial = dial</li>
      <li>@receive = receive</li>
      <li>end</li>
    </u>
    </p>

    <p>
        For now, this is all I have to say about class methods. Of course in reality there is so much more I could say but it would take away from your experience if I said too much. Till my next blog post..... click!
