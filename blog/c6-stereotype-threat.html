  <h1>Phase-0</h1>
  <h2>Stereotype Threat</h2>
  <h4>Sunday, February 1st, 2015</h4>



    <p>Stereotype threat refers to being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group (Steele & Aronson, 1995). This term was first used by Steele and Aronson (1995) who showed in several experiments that Black college freshmen and sophomores performed more poorly on standardized tests than White students when their race was emphasized. When race was not emphasized, however, Black students performed better and equivalently with White students. The results showed that performance in academic contexts can be harmed by the awareness that one's behavior might be viewed through the lens of racial stereotypes.

    <p>My name is Edgardo Ernesto Munoz. I was born in San Salvador, El Salvador C.A. My first language is Spanish. Looking at my name without looking at a picture, most people would think chances are I don't speak English, have darker brown skin, and that I'm Mexican. I say all this because that has been my experience for most of my life with most non-Hispanic people. I say 'most' because it really isn't every non-Hispanic that this applies to.
    </p>
    <p>Most of my life here in the U.S., most of the white people I've met in person have said, "I would have never guessed that your were from El Salvador, you look white". I was born with lighter skin and light eyes. Usually, it's a discovery of surprise and welcomed; However, there's been people that I've known for a while and were happy assuming my race but when confronted with the reality their presence in my life thinned out.
    </p>
    <p>I remember as a kid, moving to the U.S. was about the scariest thing I could imagine. I didn't speak English so as soon as I started school and was introduced, I didn't fit in. People would try speaking to me in English, and were surprised when I didn't respond. I feared going to school and having to deal with not understanding what was going on around me; Although I did my best to learn English as fast possible, I suffered the consequences of not learning fast enough. I had to repeat the grade I was introduced into. That tarnished my outlook on academics.
    </p>
    <p>Eventually, I became fluent in English. But that's when I really encountered my first taste of racism. I had a strong accent. Some would pick up on it and throw out their comments without any concern of the gravity of their actions. Interestingly enough, that led me to learn English better to lose the accent. But that had it's affect as well. My fluency in Spanish suffered and now, though still considered fluent by most standards, there are moments where I can't remember the proper words to finish some sentences. There's been moments in where I've wondered about the levels of my identity in terms of How american or Salvadoran I am. If I were to move back to Central America, I wouldn't fit in. But, is it ok to lose my heritage altogether and accept the gravity of my environment? I've asked myself that question so many times. It's tough to answer.

        <p>For now, this is all I have to say about Stereotype Threat. Of course in reality there is so much more I could say but it would take away from your experience if I said too much. Till my next blog post..... click!
