  <h1>Phase-0</h1>
  <h2>Questions</h2>
  <h4>Sunday, February 21nd</h4>



    <p>Hello, welcome to my blog. In this episode, we will be talking about "ASKING GOOD QUESTIONS". You might say, "well, what's a good question?", well that's a good question. From what I've gathered so far, I see that a good question is one that has been researched and thought out well before being asked. So for example, you probably don't want to go ask a professor or anyone really, "So, why is yellow?" That won't get you very far. But if you happen to take the time to look around first you'll realize that a lot of the work that you are hoping someone else might do for you, you can do for yourself. Then, if you still haven't found what you are looking for you can most likely formulate a good question. One that is specific and has enough detail and not a lot of jargon. It needs something that doesn't have to be sifted through to get the main points and the gist.
    </p>
    <p>One of the methods, to figure out a good solution or question, that I've used quite often has been the, "Rubber Ducky Method". The first time I read about it, honestly, it made me laugh. But, I soon realized that I had used it before, I just hadn't called it anything. The method entails using an inanimate object to talk to about your current issue or issues. You have to litterrally talk to it. Not in your head but talk to it like you're making a phone call to 411. When you do this you, you open up channels an informational deconstructive tool box. In a sense it's like retracing your steps. Though, in retracing your steps the objective is usually to find a physical object. In the rubber ducky method what you're doing is creating a map of the syntax that you've used. Due to it's reality, meaning it's digital existense, finding where there might be an issue is a bit more difficult. You can't push on the couch cushion to see if the code will make a noise. You have to be much more pragmatic about it.
    </p>
    <p>So after you've spent some time talking to a rubber ducky, you've either figured out the answer or you've got enough information to create a good question. You've done some research on your own. You've broken down the code and focused your energy on the part that has the most tangles. You then employed other references and wrote things down in a notepad to physically look at. BTW, reading something on paper if for one much more clear than reading from a computer screen. The clarity of print on paper well exceeds that of any, ANY!! computer screen. That and it's also a much more intimate and physical experience. You don't have to marry it but it will help you in focusing and not wearing out your eyes and patience. So after all this, you now should be ready to create a good question. A question that is full of content that is easy to read and follow by others who haven't done the research that you've done but since you have, they don't have to.
