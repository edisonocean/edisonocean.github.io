  <h1>Phase-0</h1>
  <h2>Conflict</h2>
  <h4>Sunday, February 15th</h4>



    <p>A few months ago, I moved into a house that my friends had been living in for about a year. It's a nice 3 bedroom house in midtown Santa Cruz. They were planning on traveling for a couple of months just after I moved in. In that time, they needed extra income to pay the rent on the house. So they decided to rent out the room next to mine. So they found a woman in her mid to late 40's. However, they did that while I was out. I didn't get a chance to agree or disagree on this new house-mate. I figured they were good judges of character so I went along with it. They left a couple of days after she moved in. Which is where this situation took a twist.
    </p>
    <p>The first night, she brought her boyfriend with her. He introduced himself and sounded like a good guy. Now, I'm accustomed to going to sleep between 11:30 and midnight and waking up around 6 or 6:30 am. They stayed up listening to music and talking loudly. I figured they were celebrating that she had found a new place. But it kept me up most of the night. When morning came around, I didn't feel rested at all. It was a Sunday, and I needed to get a bunch of work done for DBC, and the pressure was on since all the assignments were due that night. So the walls in the house are thin. Though this house is newer than not, it sits in a neighborhood where all the houses look very much alike. This tells me they were put up quickly in without much concern for the little details. I dismissed the first night as an isolated incident. The next couple of days, I'm assuming, she went to stay with him. But then she came back, and again he was with her. They again stayed up late and kept me awake most of the night. The next night, He stayed the night and of course the same thing happened. Next night, I used a white noise maker and turned it up to drown out their noise. But white noise makers only drown out the higher frequencies not the low of a stereo's bass. So again, I stayed up most of the night. I ask myself how someone can't figure out that it's disrespectful to do something like that. She doesn't ask to have him over, she just does it. When he introduced himself, he mentioned he was well traveled and read. Most people I know that are in that position usually have a perception of other peoples needs. And these are people close to being 50 years old. I don't get it. I feel at this point in their lives they both should be more conscious of their surroundings.
    </p>
    <p>I'm the type of person that needs plenty of sleep to have a good productive day. This situation was keeping me from having a good night's sleep which reflects on my work. So skip forward to last night. She once again had him over and again they stayed up. I woke up around 9 am. This is not working!!! So I got up and started my day. Made my coffee and walked out into the living room to start my work for DBC. She walked out of her room with a giant smile and said "good morning" to me. I can imagine I didn't look very welcoming. She walked by me and said she was going to go get a coffee and asked if she could get me one. I nodded in response and looked over at my cup which was full of coffee already. At that moment I felt like exploding with protest over what's been happening. But I held back, knowing that getting angry is no way to approach a situation. She left and came back. When she walked through the door. I didn't exactly have a pre-made dialog prepared but I caught her attention. I'm hopefully moving this week to San Francisco, and I need to be able to finish all my DBC work and take myself and my things out of town. So I need plenty of rest for energy to take on the week. So I said to her, "Look, this week I need to wake up early, and I need, preferably, just you to be quiet at night. Having your boyfriend over is not helping." She kindly agreed that she would comply with my request and walked away. So we'll see what happens tonight.
