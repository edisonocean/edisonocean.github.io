  <h1>Phase-0</h1>
  <h2>Web Security</h2>
  <h4>Sunday, February 15th</h4>



    <p>Web Security has two main components, internal and public. Websites and networks are prone to security risks. Seems the webserver and site it hosts are the main source of vulnerability. The amount of information that passes back and forth from a public or internal server to individuals will determine the level of risk. Given that your network is a financial enterprise, your risk escalates dramatically. Usually, the fact that IT departments are understaffed and underfunded leaves hackers options to take advantage of. So if you have a site that sticks out in the public eye, it's almost certain that your web security will be tested. This is usually do to poorly written code that isn't often updated.
    </p>The type of websites that have a high rate of vulnerability are those that require customers or users to enter information in prompt boxes. Additionally, those that allow for many commands to be executed publicly leave options for hackers to insert their scripts. These sites usually are made up of SQL, MySQL and other database style programs. So a server that has few open ports, will generally have a low security risk.
    <p>Fortunately, most "hackers" are considered copycats. That is, they aren't as savvy as they would like to be and use other pre-made code to execute their mischief. However, most of the time, some of the exploits are extremely difficult to detect. These are made by individuals or a group. And though it may sound easy for someone educated in programming, it usually takes hundreds of work hours to create something that will turn out an extreme danger. Though, sometimes, even a child can come up with a simple program and employ it to do something that can throw a wrench in a large machine.
    </p>The W3C is currently coming up with policies to achieve protocols that will standardize security systems. For example: "the WebCrypto group is defining an API to expose trusted cryptographic primitives from the browser.", "WebAppSec is developing the Content Security Policy and CSP Level 2; Cross-Origin Resource Sharing; UI Security; Subresource Integrity and Mixed Content Recommendations. This work aims to enable secure mash-ups, address click-jacking, and to create a more robust Web security environment through light-weight policy expression that meshes with HTML5's built-in security policies.", These were sections taken from the W3C website.
    <p>Among all of this, there is also such a thing as "Pervasive Monitoring". This is what is also know as "evesdropping" by third party sites and other more centralized parties like governmental offices. The W3C, recently held a day and set its purpose to "Strengthening Web Security on The Day We Fight Back (11 Feb, 2014)" The ideas was to get members and communities to get active and help produce plans for better web security and privacy. The say, "We see pervasive monitoring as an attack on the Web and its users. The Web is for everyone. The W3C community builds Web protocols and formats to enable individuals and groups to communicate with those they are trying to reach, and to protect those communications from eavesdropping of third parties."  </p>
    <p>So the main thing that I learned about this is that the best way to prevent an interruption such as an attack on your system is simply to turn off your server when you're done with it. Interesting concept.</p>
