  <h1>Technical Blog Week-2</h1>
  <h2>CSS Definitions</h2>
  <h4>December 27th</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>PADDING: I understand this as the distance between the context and the border.
        </li>

       <li>BORDER: I understand this as the distance between the edge of the padding and the margin.
       </li>

       <li>MARGIN: I understand this as the very edge of a box. And a margin can be thickened to be seen as a frame.
       </li>
     </ul>

       <p>I feel this image give a very good visual description of what each of these means. It's a bit tricky to try and explain how to use these in conjuction with positioning because I don't know how to describe positioning quite yet. I will try to explain how to use padding, border, and margin alone. Let's say you've uploaded an image and you want to use these. The padding will give you space between the image and the border. kind of like the matte board inside a house frame holding a photo. So you can set it to be as thin or thick as you want; however, unlike the matte board, if the padding is set too small, the image will be shrunk down in attempt to fit. Now the border, Think of this like the frame of that photo. You can have as big a frame as you want but not smaller than the padding. The Margin, is like the wall on which you'd hang that frame. That all depends on you and where you want the image to be on that wall.

        I was confused by this for a while. I was able to make sense of this by checking out <a href="http://css-tricks.com/the-difference-between-id-and-class/">this link</a> . As far as I see it, a single class can be used multiple times in a website and the page will validate. Where as an id can only be used once per element. If attempted multiple times, the page will not validate. Also, an id can be used in a url. ie.  www.page.com/#id

        The differences between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning are still a mystery to me. I don't want to pretend I know, so I'll I will be deligently researching until I can come back and explain easily.

        What does it mean to display inline vs inline blocks? I undestand it as display:inline will display text next to each other from left to right. display: inline-block simply means you're adding quadrangles to your text. However, in this situation you can size the quadrangles to whatever size you want.
