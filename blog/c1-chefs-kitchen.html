      So far my impression of Shereef is that he seems to be a very compassionate person. His ability to understand that all of us come from different backgrounds and have similar fears, leads me to believe I made the right decision in joining the DBC family. That being said, it's my belief that family or team based environment creates solidarity and feeling of dedication that would otherwise not be as strong or apparent. And Shereef being the base of DBC, compassion can only be a natural progression for each team member.

        I actually chose DBC instead of a different bootcamp because of its focus on community and family type ideals. I feel there is a lack of integrity in the world. I believe an entity such as DBC that accepts the responsibility to teach its students to engage in and practice empathy, integrity, and kindness can only produce a better human for tomorrow.

        Just like everyone else, I have my fears of how I'll fit in. That includes questions like: Will I learn fast enough? Will I be kind and empathetic enough? Do I really understand what kindness is? Will I get hired into a job that feels right for my life? Or will I follow the path of the working stiffs? However, I don't focus on those fears, I immediatly look at the opposite of them and find a spot that feels comfortable enough to continue on this path. I am excited to get to the end of Phase 0. I'll be the one walking in with the apron and a wrench :-) ready to go.
