  <h1>Phase-0-Unit-1-Week-3</h1>
  <h2>TECH BLOG: arrays AND hashes!!</h2>
  <h4>Friday, January 9th, 2015</h4>



    <p>
      Hello Folks!!!, Today we'll be reviewing Arrays and Hashes... I know, you're all besides yourselves. Ok, I know you'll make a ton of friends but, settle down. Now, in this Ruby world that we are in, when we say the word "arrays" what we're talking about is a sequence of numbers, letters, words, etc. or a sequence of sequences of numbers,letters, words, etc. But it gets more involved than that. Another way to look at it is that it's a manner in arranging all these things I just mentioned. Something that's related to this is "hashes". Creating a hash allows us to do the same thing but in a slightly different way. All in all, we can say that by using one or the other, we can achieve the same result. I'll try to keep it as simple as possible in this blog. However, if you feel like you need further explanation, I'll also provide links to resources that I feel go further into describing what these two super heroes are capable of doing.
    </p>

    <h1>What are arrays?</h1>

    <p>Saying the word 'arrays' is just another way of saying ['a word', 'or written number like 'four'', 'or an integer like '3'', ['or a sequence in brackets inside', 'a sequence, that's already', 'in brackets', 'like this one'] ]. As you can see, there are square brackets that I used to contain a list of things. Inside those brackets, they were separated by commas, and each series of words that I called "things" is called a string. A string is each collection of words that I wrapped in single quotes like this 'blah blah blah'. An example of what an array might actually look like in a document goes like this:
   </p>
      <p>
        array_1 = ['hi', 45, 'my favorite', 'number', ['this', 'is', 2], ['arrays', 'inside', 1, 'array']] .
      </p>

     <p>For us to use this array in a funtional way, we need to say:</p>

    <dl>
     <dt>puts array_1 [0]</dt>
     <dt>puts array_1 [6]</dt>
     <dt>puts array_1 [3]</dt>
     <dt>puts array_1 [2]</dt>
     <dt>puts array_1 [6]</dt>
   </dl>



     <p>This will return (print out) the items inside the array called 'array_1' in the order as specified by the numbers inside the square brackets '[#]'. Notice that there is a zero inside one of the square brackets? In the programming world, the first item in a list, starts with zero. So, in array_1, the first item is 'hi' and its place in the lineup is zero.</p>

     <p>If you'd like to see more and actually get some practice, here is a good link so you can get some eperience: <a href= "http://www.codecademy.com/courses/ruby-beginner-en-F3loB/0/1?curriculum_id=5059f8619189a5000201fbcb "><img style="border-color:white" alt="Codecademy" src="http://cdn-production.codecademy.com/assets/logo/logo--dark-blue-bf11002ce1caecdfb9fec8d3286b8a8d.svg" height="25px" width="100px"></a>
     </p>

     <p>
        Now... a hash is a different way of doing the same thing. Some would say, it's easier; Yet, others would say it's not any easier; However, in the end, the product is just the same. I see it as just two different flavors and either way, you'll get to eat. However, as humans are said to have 5 senses, hashes seem to have at least one more sense than arrays do. Here is an example of a hash.</p>

<dl>
       <dt> hash = {</dt>
  <dt>key1 => value1,</dt>
 <dt> key2 => value2,</dt>
  <dt>key3 => value3</dt>
<dt>}</dt>
</dl>

<p></p>
<dl>
<dt>puts hash["key1"]</dt>
<dt>puts hash["key2"]</dt>
<dt>puts hash["key3"]</dt>
</dl>

        <p> Let's see if I can explain this. 'hash' is, at this point, a variable that is representing all the 'key#'s inside the curly brackets. It's like their lawyer :-). The 'key#'s are then pointing at their respective values. Now, what makes this easy to use, is the fact that we can call on 'hash' to print out the keys. We just need to memorize the syntax on how to do it. So:</p>

         <p>puts hash["key1"]  will return (print out) 'value1'</p>

        <p>It's as simple as that.</p>
