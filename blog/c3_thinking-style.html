  <h1>Phase-0-Unit-1-Week-3</h1>
  <h2>CULTURAL BLOG: Thinking Style!!</h2>
  <h4>Friday, January 9th, 2015</h4>



    <p> In this blog I'll be reflecting on my experience with Phase-0, my style of thinking as identified by Dr. Anthony Gregorc, The style of mindset I embody, and how it all comes together as a system for me as a Boot (student) at Dev Bootcamp. Having a good idea of how something works, allows for a more efficient and clear idea of how to move forward with any systematic plan. I find it also assists in quickly creating solutions when something isn't working as expected.</p>
    <p>When we began our studies at DBC, we had to take a test to see what style of thinking each of us encompassed. The test was created by Dr. Anthony Gregorc and it provides a systematic method of discovering our personal style of thinking. There are four styles this test determines (Concrete Sequential, Abstract Sequential, Concrete Random, and Abstract Random). If you'd like to take the test, here is the link <a href= "http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html"> Mindset Test</a> and here is the link to the descriptions <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm"> Mindsets</a>. I took a gander at the four descriptions before taking the test and took a guess as to which one I would fit into. I, then, took the test and it turned out that I guessed right. I fell into the CONCRETE RANDOM category. Here is the list of attributes that category entails: </p>

      <h1>Concrete Random</h1>
      <dl>
<dt>This learner likes:</dt>

         <dd>logical sequence</dd>
         <dd>following directions, predictability</dd>
         <dd>getting facts</dd>
<dt>They learn best when:</dt>
         <dd>they have a structured environment</dd>
         <dd>they can rely on others to complete this task</dd>
         <dd>are faced with predictable situations</dd>
         <dd>can apply ideas in pragmatic ways</dd>
<dt>What's hard for them?</dt>
          <dd> Working in groups</dd>
          <dd>Discussions that seem to have no specific point</dd>
          <dd>Working in an unorganized environment</dd>
          <dd>Following incomplete or unclear directions</dd>
          <dd>Working with unpredictable people</dd>
          <dd>Dealing with abstract ideas</dd>
          <dd>Demands to "use your imagination"</dd>
          <dd>Questions with no right or wrong answers</dd>
      </dl>


    <p>My experience in Phase-0 has been very possitive. I have found because of all the years of being part of the traditional style of our educational system, I have had quite the learning curve in my attempt to get acclimated to DBC's style of teaching. However, I feel that in the third week of Phase-0-Unit-1, I'm more in tune with the format. DBC's curriculum is full of resources to guide you through when you're feeling lost. Our community is the first line of defense against confusion and frustration. Followed by the Office Hours and Tutoring sessions. I've had the privilage of speaking with people who have good friends in the last Phase. They were kind enough to share how they feel about Phase-0. From what I gather, it's concurred that having Phase-0 before the on-campus training is KEY!!! to success in the journey. I have found that identifying your strengths and weaknesess, with the previously mentioned test, offers great insight as to what you should do in order to succeed as a student at DBC; Furthermore, if you pay attention, you can pick out who else may fall in the same catagory as you. Which leads to understanding weather or not you can work with that person. And what it would take to work with them harmoniously.
</p>
<p> Another personal learning resource given to us is a comparison of a fixed mindset vs. a growth mindset. My understanding of it is that a fixed midset entails a person with qualities that hinder expansion of the mind and it's attributes that allow for taking in new and beneficial information leading to the expansion of understanding and intelligence. I believe we, as humans, embody a mix of both mindsets depending on what situation we are placed in. In terms of a situation like DBC, I feel it would be advantageous for any new student to figure out which mindset they fall into. Seeing yourself from the outside in, allows for a person to identify where there exists gaps and what is needed to fill in those gaps. I've learned so much, in these past few weeks, about programming and equally about myself, what type of person I am, what type of person I want to be, what I need to do to become that person, and most of all.... that it is possible.  </p>
