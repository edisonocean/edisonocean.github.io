  <h1>Phase-0</h1>
  <h2>What is Phase-0 like?</h2>
  <h4>Monday, December 21nd</h4>



    <p>
      Welcome to my blog. This will give me a chance to reflect on the process of Phase-0 Unit-1.
      I have found one of the most important steps to take to prepare for this phase is to think about what it is you already know. Then ask yourself if there is something you need to brush up on. If there is, most likely you will encounter it once your this phase. It would be to your benefit to become confident in those skills.

    <p>
        There are plenty of resources out there for you to reference; However, it would behoove you to create contacts with the folks in your cohort. These peeps will back you up when you're feeling lost. But make sure you have their backs when they are in need. You can do that by using the social media provided by dbc. Just gotta keep up with it.
    </p>
    <p>
        For now, this is all I have to say about Phase-0. Of course in reality there is so much more I could say but it would take away from your experience if I said too much. Till my next blog post..... click!
