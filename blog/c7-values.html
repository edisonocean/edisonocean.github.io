            When you think of the times in your life where youâ€™ve been the
            happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, which of the following
            values come to mind?

                    <h3>In general, I try to live up to these values:</h3>
                    <h3>Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 -----<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">4</span>----- 5 Agree</h3>
                    <p></p>
                    I would say, in general, I try very hard to reach these levels of living. But on a daily basis, it's proves very difficult to have this sort of consistency. Just last year, I lost three very good friends. Among them, my best friend for the last fifteen years. I don't know if I'll ever get over that. I had to put my dog to sleep. She was a herding dog, and it was her nature to nip at the ankles when she felt she was herding. Anyway, she nipped the wrong person and now I'm being sued. All that on top of other events that may not be appropriate to mentions on this blog.
                   </p>

                    <p><h3>Pick one value and write a couple of sentences about why the value you chose is important to you:</h3>
                      <h3>
                        Friendship
                      </h3>
                      I'm choosing to write about friendship. I think most people would agree that family is, more often than not, the people that should matter to you the most. However, if the measurement of a person's connection to another person is what creates importance. The next best thing to family, is friendship. True friendship can be just as strong, meaningful, and important. There's a certain point where the lines of friendship blend with the lines of family. I've met older people and heard them talk about multiple friends that they've known for 20, 30, 40 years plus. I find that to be amazing. In witnessing this, I've noticed a quality in the level of happiness. It's almost a proud happy. So I would say for me, the reason I chose to write about this <em>is</em> because of how I view friendship. Because I feel friendships are an instance of a miracle.

                    <h3>What was the last topic that someone asked for your advice on? Did it relate to any of the values you found important?</h3>
                    <h3>
                        Respect
                    </h3>
                    A close friend asked me for advice on how to communicate with a family member who wasn't aware of their destructive intrusiveness. Another close friend has, recently, been giving me different resources on how to communicate with people so as to make the conversation neutral if it begins to elevate to a heated level. It's called 'non-violent communication'. With the amount of technique I know, I was told their conversation went just as they'd hoped.

                    <h3>How do you feel when you think about your values? Do you think it can help you mediate stereotype threat if you recognize you feel it?</h3>
                    <h3>
                        Non-Violent Communication
                    </h3>
                    Since I can remember, I've always had trouble communicating completely what's on my mind. It's often lead to unwanted results. And in situations where, for example "stereotype threat" may be involved, I would typically react instead of staying calm and collected. Since studying the methods of Non-Violent Communication, I've been confronted with every type of situation that I would normally not do so good in. I'm no expert, by far, but more often than not, I've walked away feeling good that the issues were either resolved or at least were inhibited from elevating.
