  <h1>Phase-0-Unit-2-Week-5</h1>
  <h2>Cultural Blog</h2>
  <h4>Sunday, January 25th</h4>




     <p>Welcome back!!! on this episode, we'll be looking into the "Pairing Sessions" that, as a DBC Boot, you are required to do. We are in Phase-0-Unit-2-Week-5 and up to this point, we have paired at least twice per week. On some weeks, I've paired up to 5 or 6 times. We are required to pair a minimum amount of times; However as I've found, It seems to help at times to have someone to talk with as you are setting up for your endevour. The beauty about that is the diverse backgrounds of each individual. Some people are frome outside of the U.S.A. and are currently working remotely with DBC, like me and the rest of the Cohort. But you get to find out current events in their home country, what sort of tech trends are occurring there, what type of experience that person had before DBC, (etc.) Sometimes, the person who you pair with has had previous programming experience and they are willing to teach you what they know; Thereby, increasing your comprehension, speed, and flexibility.</p>

    <p>-What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges?
      Because DBC's curriculum moves at such a fast pace, having a partner to work with makes the daunting feel of some of the challenges diminish. At the beginning you both decide who will be reciting the code or aka "The Navigator", and who, then, will be typing the code that is being recited aka "The Driver". Creating boundaries at the beginning helps to cut down the confusion of who "should" have what role. Occasionally, those boundaries get crossed. But DBC helps you understand how to ask someone not to do that, without making them feel guarded, uncomfortable, or offended.

    <p>- Was something particularly fun or rewarding?
      I've had pairing sessions where, it seems, half of the time all we do is laugh. It seems, because of the nature of the curriculum, most people have a tacit understanding of belonging and respect. We're all trying to get throught the same thing. And having a good attitude only makes sense to create a good atmosphere.

    <p>- Was something frustrating and difficult for yoa
        I would say if there was anything frustrating and difficult, it most definitely had nothing to do with my fellow Boots. That frustration has more to do with Google+ Hangouts when the screen freezes, or shuts off on you; Additionally, the microphone consistantly cuts out. But there are other options, ie. Skype and other apps like it.
