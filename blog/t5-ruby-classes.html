  <h2>Lets Talk About Class!!!</h2>
  <h4>Sunday, January 25nd</h4>



    <p>
      Welcome to my blog!!! On this episode, we'll be visiting the world of Ruby Classes. Now before you start putting your notebook in your backpack and packing a lunch for break time, let me clarify :-) I'm not talking about a class that you attend, sit, and learn. Although,I'm sure those are avialable at a school near you and for sure on-line. The "Classes" I'm referring to are tools, as it were, that are available to us to use within the Ruby world. Just like any language, Ruby has structure. It has rules and a sense of order. In spoken languages, certain words have specific funtions and a connection to the words that will come before and after it. It contains words that act much like tools, in that they allow for options to become available, upon implementation, to the person/s using them. Let's explore just a few of these so you can get glimpse of what they're about.
    </p>
    <p>Ruby is an Object Oriented Programing language. You may have seen the abreviation "O.O.P.", in an magazine article or on the web. So just to get it out of the way, because Ruby is mainly an O.O.P. language, Classes are considered "First-Class Objects". Meaning they are very very powerful in the range of duties that they can perform. They're like the Swiss Army knives of the computer world. Objects are considered containers that can hold data, control access to the data, among a few other things they also have, what are called attributes(like all the tools in a Swiss Army knife.)
    </p> Let's take a look at what a created Class might look like:

    <ul>
      <li>class Telephone</li>
      <li>def initialize(dial, receive)</li>
      <li>@dial = dial</li>
      <li>@receive = receive</li>
      <li>end</li>
    </u>
    <p>So As you can see, we created a class called Telephone. Below it, you can see that there are some values belonging to it. The beauty about most of these values, is that they are objects too. Or at least act like them. Which gives us a multitude of flexibility if we wanted to use them for something else or somewhere else. I'm going to stop here and have you ponder this for a little while. Check back in the next couple of days. There will be much more information regarding "what else can we do with this"?</p>
