  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>My Name Is Edgardo Ernesto Munoz A.K.A. Edison Ocean Reef. Currently I live in Santa Cruz, California and I’ll be attending the San Francisco campus in Feb. I’m originally from El Salvador, San Salvador, C.A.. I graduated from U.C.S.C. with a B.A. in Photography. I have fallen in love with coding since I started. I began when I was about 13 years old. I remember spending hours and hours learning code. I eventually created a program for an alarm clock that played 'mary had a little lamb' as the alarm. Went on with it for a couple of years then I forgot about it for a while. I took up other hobbies (skateboarding, snowboarding, surfing, downhill mtb, dirt jumping on dj mtb’s, drums, guitar, school, college, friends, girlfriends, etc.). Anyway, I’ve recently picked it up again and I’m into it more than ever. I’m excited to begin at the San Francisco location. I feel I would be more confident with people around who are at the same level and physically there to ask and collaborate with. I’m excited to begin to create functional programs that I can share with others. Eventually, I’d like to create a program to make it easier for the I can reach to, somehow be more kind to the earth. I realize that sounds very hippie-ish but I’d like to leave my kids a clean house when I’m gone. Enough of that though, for now I want to have fun with all of this. I can pair just about any time. Peace! -Eddie Munoz
